The objective of this puzzle is to find and mark all the words hidden inside the box. The words may be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

- Run puzzle_program.py or another_program_puzzle.py to spawn a word search grid.
- Enter the found word, the direction it is going in and the found row or column. If the word is correctly facing the specified direction and inside the row or column, then the current player gets a point. If not, the word is erased from the playing space and the next player takes a turn.
- Points are generated by the number of remaining words and the direction of the found word. Words in the up direction are given (4 * remaining words) points, words in the down direction are given (2 * remaining words) points, words in the forward direction are given (1 * remaining ords) points and words in the backward direction are given (3 * remaining words) points - where * is a symbol for multiply. If a player finds the last word in the word space, they are given an extra 25 points.
- The game end when all words in the playing space are gone, and the player with the highest score wins.
